# mod2obj
The current version requires you to use Pidi64's or Renol's ModExtract tool to acquire the individual sections. You place them in the same directory as the python file along with a text file called "funy" that will hold the obj information.

The most you can expect with this tool right now is a .obj that has correct vertices and normals but messed up faces. I recommend using MeshLab since it's the most compatible with the outputted model.

THIS PROGRAM IS SEVERELY OUTDATED.  PLEASE WAIT FOR WHEN I RELEASE A BETTER VERSION OF THIS TOOL.
